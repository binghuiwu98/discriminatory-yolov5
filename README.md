1.We present a urine sdiment dataset called Urised2
k.
We collect 2465 images without stained which are taken under the automatic urine sediment detector.
The automatic urine sediment detector can automatically detect the position of the sample to aspirate, mix, and settle. Then it takes a picture of the sample in the catheter through a microscope.

The resolution of the urine sediment microscopy images is 800*600.

We annotate seven major categories in our urine sediment dataset, including leukocyte, erythrocyte, broken leukocyte, broken erythrocyte, mycete, crystal and epithelial cells.

We annotate the images with rectangular boxes whose labels follow VOC format. Each box contains the value of the category and the coordinates of the upper left and lower right corners.

The classes in xml file b, h, pb, ph, m, j, s respectively presents leukocyte (or white blood cells WBCs), erythrocyte (or red blood cells RBCs), broken leukocyte, broken erythrocyte, mycete, crystal and epithelial cells

The dataset is freely available at Baiduyun Driver(链接：https://pan.baidu.com/s/195pHrLhPfNE8-tkuYbo7uA 提取码：zjut)
